# GOALS

I can TDD anything.
I can program fluently
I can debug anything

## What I should be working towards each week

https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/week_outlines.md

## Week 1

* Really understand TDD
* get my hands dirty and write code which is driven by unit tests
* break my habit of wanting to write code before the tests!
* improve on my pair programming technique

# Did I reach my goals?
* Really understand TDD - I feel I have an understanding. do I really understand it? Not yet,  I feel I am let down with my knowledge of the testing framework and also knowledge in terms of constructing a good test.
* get my hands dirty and write code which is driven by unit tests - I've done plenty of that. Very enjoyable. More please
* break my habit of wanting to write code before the tests! - I feel I am still guilty of moving to my code to soon. I need to further practice the red, green, refactor philosophy
* improve on my pair programming technique - It's getting better so I have achieved this. However I need to slow down a little based on feedback from my peers.

## Week 2
* I write code that is easy to change

  Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.

* I can test-drive my code

  Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.

* I can build with objects

  Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.

  * I want to use dependancy injection in the code I write
  * I want to make use of polymophism in the code I write through the use of duck typing.
  * Strive for SRP
