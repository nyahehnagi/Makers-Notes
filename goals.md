# GOALS

I can TDD anything.
I can program fluently
I can debug anything

## What I should be working towards each week

https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/week_outlines.md

## Week 1

* Really understand TDD
* get my hands dirty and write code which is driven by unit tests
* break my habit of wanting to write code before the tests!
* improve on my pair programming technique

# Did I reach my goals?
* Really understand TDD - I feel I have an understanding. do I really understand it? Not yet,  I feel I am let down with my knowledge of the testing framework and also knowledge in terms of constructing a good test.
* get my hands dirty and write code which is driven by unit tests - I've done plenty of that. Very enjoyable. More please
* break my habit of wanting to write code before the tests! - I feel I am still guilty of moving to my code to soon. I need to further practice the red, green, refactor philosophy
* improve on my pair programming technique - It's getting better so I have achieved this. However I need to slow down a little based on feedback from my peers.

## Week 2
* I write code that is easy to change

  Writing easy to change software is highly prized amongst developers and employers. By developers because most of a developer's time is spent changing software. By employers because their teams can deliver value to customers faster.

* I can test-drive my code

  Tested software is easier to change because you can tell when it's broken just by running a command, even the tricky edge cases.

* I can build with objects

  Most code in the world is structured in small pieces called objects. This is done because it is easier to change than having everything in one place.

  * I want to use dependancy injection in the code I write
  * I want to make use of polymophism in the code I write through the use of duck typing.
  * Strive for SRP

  ## Did I reach my goals?

  Again, kind of.

  I can write code that is relatively easy to change, but when I went to change some of it, it was not easy.. so more practice needed

  test driving my code is definitely a work in progress. I tried to do that with the Takeaway challenge but I found myself coding before testing. Some of it I feel is I don't have the knowledge of what I am meant to be testing. A case in point here was the SMS testing. I wrote the code as I wrote the tests and updated the tests later on as I became more aware of how to stub. Next time I think I';ll write tests without stubbing and refactor later

  I incorporated dependancy injection into my Takeaway challenge and also popped a polymorphic object in with the Messsenger class.

  As for SRP, in the most part yes, I need to get the code reviewed. Again practice practice, practice

  ## Week 3

  * Build a simple web app
  * Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
  * Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
  * Explain the MVC pattern

  Did I reach them.. I feel I have. Working with a web app was totally new to me and the weekend challenge consolidated my understanding. The weekend challenge was rock paper scissors which really helped in wrapping my head around routing and the use of the MVC pattern

  ## Week 4

  * Build a simple web app with a database
  * Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
  * Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

  Met the goals? This week, absolutely and some. It was a good week

  Big step up this week as databases were introduced. This was also a big week for me as I became aware of the use of REST. Fortunately I have had some experience with databases in the past, so the use of SQL was not unfamaliar. What was a game changer was the use of REST, all of a sudden web apps and routing became so much more organised. If I had know about REST in last weeks RPS challenge the code would have been much cleaner. 

  The weekend challenge I went to town on and added all manner of cool functionalilty including logon, authentication, flash messaging, encryption and a rakefile. I tried to get the app on to Heroku but that did not work... 

  One thing that did not sit well was all the database code sitting in the model... I then discovered ORM.. that is for next week though

  ## Week 5

  By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

  * Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
  * Build to a specification (rather than challenges)
  * Run stand-ups and retrospectives
  * Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
  * Give and receive meaningful code review
