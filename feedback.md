## From Claire Nelson
* **What did you learn from pairing with me?**
* To spot obvious rows of code where bugs might lie and to google for unknown methods
* **What do you think of the code we wrote together?**
* Simple and effective
* **Could you summarise the work we did together?**
* We debugged the second exercise of the debugging skills workshop which related to Ciphers
* **Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?**
* Good balance
* **What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?**
* You looked at what the problem was and deduced where the issue might lie, reducing down the code we should be investigating
