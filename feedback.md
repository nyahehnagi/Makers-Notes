## Week 1 Feedback

* **What did you learn from pairing with me?**
To spot obvious rows of code where bugs might lie and to google for unknown methods
* **What do you think of the code we wrote together?**
Simple and effective
* **Could you summarise the work we did together?**
We debugged the second exercise of the debugging skills workshop which related to Ciphers
* **Was I too quiet, too talkative, or did I strike a good balance of speaking and listening?**
Good balance
* **What one thing did I explain well? What one thing did I explain not so well?**
You looked at what the problem was and deduced where the issue might lie, reducing down the code we should be investigating

---------------------------------------

* **What did we work on together?**
We worked on the Boris Bike Challenges 9 - 11
* **What do you think about the code we wrote together?**
Clean, neat and clear. Leaving in alternative ways of writing code/tests helped me understand how predicate matchers work.
* **What did you learn from pairing with me today?**
Improved my knowledge on how to interpret and write spec tests.
Learnt how to reverse git commits and pushes.
Learnt about testing behaviour and state.
Predicate matchers
* **What one thing did I do well on?**
Communicated well and clarified anything that was needed.
* **What one thing could I improve on?**
The pace was a bit faster than what I'm used to.

------------------------------------

* **What did we work on together?**
Boris bike tasks 12-18
* **What do you think about the code we wrote together?**
I think it was pretty tidy by the end - you are good at finding ways to refactor and neaten/shorten the code.
* **What did you learn from pairing with me today?**
Learnt about code blocks inside expect {} and let.
* **What one thing did I do well on?**
Good at sharing and explaining knowledge that I didn't have.
* **What one thing could I improve on?**
the lines between naviagtor and driver ended up being a bit blurred at times (also my fault too). Maybe focusing more on delivering each role in a slightly stricter manner?


------------------------------------

* **What did we work on together?**
Boris Bikes challenges 13 and 14
* **What do you think about the code we wrote together?**
It worked! I understood most of it and anything I didn't you were great at explaining and allowed me to rephrase it back to you with corrections.
* **What did you learn from pairing with me today?**
How to use constants.
* **What one thing did I do well on?**
Excellent navigating and telling me what you wanted me to write down. Thank you for your patience on my much poorer navigating.
* **What one thing could I improve on?**
Explain what your thought process is before typing so we're both on the same page,

## Week 2 Feedback

* **What did we work on together?**
The weekly pairing program to practice TDD emulating an Oyster card
* **What do you think about the code we wrote together?**
Very clean, tested and refactored.
* **What did you learn from pairing with me today?**
I learned how to rescue an error message and write a feature spec
* **What one thing did I do well on?**
Logically thinking through object creations by creating simple tests. Linking and creating gemfile. Writing clear README ans well as a doc to track our progress.
* **What one thing could I improve on?**
Could test VScode live share audio next time

* **What did we work on together?**
Oystercard pairing exercise 9-11
* **What do you think about the code we wrote together?**
Works well and implementing feature spec helped us both break down the user story better.
* **What did you learn from pairing with me today?**
I gained a better understanding of when to use doubles.
* **What one thing did I do well on?**
Using TDD well by methodically working on the current failing test rather than focusing on other errors that can surface when making changes.
* **What one thing could I improve on?**
As driver, on occasion I needed to refresh my understanding. Perhaps we could have made a few more pauses to check we are still on the same train of thought.


* **What did we work on together?**
Oystercard challenge
* **What do you think about the code we wrote together?**
Pretty awesome
* **What did you learn from pairing with me today?**
How to implement include correctly into rspec and how to create a shared_context.
* **What one thing did I do well on?**
Having a good explanation for the questions I asked
* **What one thing could I improve on?**
Nothing I can think of
