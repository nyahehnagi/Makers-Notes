# ALL ABOUT JAVASCRIPT

# By the end of the week all developers can:

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

## External Process Review

Had a crack at one of these. Overall it went well, the key feedback to me was to generalise my testing more so and to refactor after each green.
There was no issue with mmy coding skills which was good to hear.

## Java script

* user for the front end
* primarily a front end language
* affects what we see on the screen
* Browser invokes the code
* Not only a front end language e.g NodeJS
* dynamnically updates pages through the DOM
* security
* created in 10 days by Brendan Eich
* high level language, further away from the binary code
* jQuery - javascript library
* ES6 transpiling
* interpreted language - not compiled
  - Compiled - convered into machine code- need to know in advance size of variables etc
  - interpreted, converted at runtime - dynamic

Translate what you know into something you don't know... aka Ruby to Javascript

 # Debugging in Javascript

 Print lines of code 
 Read  the errors
 learning to interpret error messages
 concentrate on one bug of a time
 locate where the bug is
 It's a way to consolidate your understanding of the code
 Watch your syntax, brackets etc
 Have you written a testy to cover it
 Tighten the loop
 Following the flow of control

----------------

What is this persons motivation

Want to get things done
A planner
Like to take control
Leading
Goal orientated
