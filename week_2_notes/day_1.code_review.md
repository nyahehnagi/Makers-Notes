* How to review code - the process

Did a code review on my pair's code.

started working on weekly OysterCard challenge

I furthered my knowledge of dependancy injection - including ways of doing so e.g
* Directly passing in an object
* Imprezzo : Of Class e.g MyClass(other_class = MyOtherClass)
* You can perform injection through 
  - constructor injection - for when a class needs the object to work properly - spans multiple methods
  - method injection - use once only applications
  - property injection - generally bad to use
