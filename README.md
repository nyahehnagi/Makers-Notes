# Makers-Notes

Within this repo are the notes, learns, evidence and reflections of my time on the Makers Coding Bootcamp

This is by no means a perfect recount and I am in no doubt I will have missed notes, comments, great ideas and thoughts. However I will do the best I can to get as much useful into this repo for my own sake and potentially anyone else who happens to read this

The information contained within comprises of the following documents

* ## day_x_description.md 

Raw information captured on a daily basis, it will include notes I take during the day, useful links to sites that may have been of interest and use, links to code repos that I may have worked on and new coding ideas and thoughts that I may have come across.

An example file is day_1_goals.md

* ## learning_tracker.md 

This will capture my key learning points for each week. I've split this into various sections which include Techniques and Ways of Working, Coding Ideas and Evidence of my work

* ## goals.md

This will capture my weekly goals and whether I met them.
