# Test Driven Development (John Forster)

# Goals
explain why we do TDD
Describe the steps of a TDD dev process

# Why are test useful?
Make sure it works
Understanding and clarifying the user requirements
Opportunity to find missing requirements
Provides confidence when making changes
Form of documentation
Test coverage, helps you find non functional code.
Capture unhappy paths
Save time in the long run
help design incrementally

# Why write tests first
Structure code and write what's necessary
Incremental development
Stick to the specification
Help with clarity of requirements
Help think about only one thing at a time.
Planning ahead and focusing on where you want to be
Ensuring you have good code coverage

We ran through a quick exercise to see what the TDD process is.

Key note to take away - ensure to write the code to pass the test!!
